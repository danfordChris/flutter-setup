# Flutter Setup Script – Full Documentation

## Overview

`flutter_setup` is a global CLI script that automatically creates a fully structured Flutter project with:

- Clean architecture folder structure
- Pre-installed dependencies
- Pre-configured Makefile
- Localization setup
- Theme setup
- Extension utilities
- Code generator template
- Asset directories
- Feature-based modular structure

This script saves hours of manual setup and enforces consistency across projects.

# Installation (Global Usage)

## 1️⃣ Move Script to Global Location

Rename your script to `flutter_setup` and move it to a global binary directory:

```bash
sudo mv flutter_setup /usr/local/bin/flutter_setup
```

---

## 2️⃣ Make It Executable

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/flutter_setup
```

---

## 3️⃣ Test Installation

Run from anywhere:

```bash
flutter_setup my_app
```

This will create a new Flutter project named `my_app` in your current directory.

---

# What the Script Does

When you run:

```bash
flutter_setup my_app
```

The script performs the following steps:

---

## 1. Creates Flutter Project

```bash
flutter create my_app
```

---

## 2. Installs Required Packages

Automatically installs:

- `go_router`
- `flutter_pack`

Then runs:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

## 3. Generates Folder Structure

```
lib/
├── core/
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── extensions/
│   ├── mixins/
│   ├── resources/
│   ├── theme/
│   └── utils/
├── dao/
├── features/
├── l10n/
├── root/
├── services/
└── shared/
    ├── components/
    └── controllers/
```

Also creates:

```
assets/
├── fonts/
├── images/
└── svgs/
```

---

## 4. Creates Preconfigured Files

### Extensions

- Theme access
- Color scheme
- Text styles
- MediaQuery width/height
- GoRouter state access

---

### Theme System

- `AppTheme`
- `CustomColors`
- Material 3 enabled

---

### Localization

ARB files included:

- English
- Arabic
- Spanish
- French
- Swahili

---

### Splash Screen

Basic splash screen template inside:

```
lib/root/splash_screen.dart
```

---

### Resource Exports

- Fonts
- Images
- SVGs

---

### Code Generator

Automatically generates:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_pack/flutter_pack.dart';

void main() {
  List<BaseModelGenerator> generator = [];
  CodeGenerator.of('your_project_name', generator).generate();
}
```

The project name is dynamically injected.

---

### Makefile Included

Preconfigured commands:

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| make help | Show all commands |
| make run | Run app |
| make clean | Clean project |
| make get | Get dependencies |
| make upgrade | Upgrade packages |
| make apk | Build release APK |
| make apk_debug | Build debug APK |
| make feature name=auth | Generate feature structure |
| make test | Run tests |
| make analyze | Analyze code |
| make format | Format code |
| make coverage | Test with coverage |
| make doctor | Run flutter doctor |

---

# Creating a Feature

Example:

```bash
make feature name=auth
```

Creates:

```
lib/features/auth/
├── controllers/
├── services/
├── models/
├── screens/
└── widgets/
```

---

# Recommended Workflow

After project creation:

```bash
cd my_app
make setup
make feature name=auth
make run
```

---

# Requirements

- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- Dart SDK
- Make installed (Mac/Linux default)

---

# Updating the Script

If you update the script:

```bash
sudo mv flutter_setup /usr/local/bin/flutter_setup
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/flutter_setup
```

---

# Troubleshooting

## Permission Denied

Run:

```bash
chmod +x flutter_setup
```

## Command Not Found

Ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If missing, add to `.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

# Why Use This Script?
